# This is an example of a For loop. This function prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples
of three prints "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five prints "Buzz". For numbers
which are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".

# Begin Loop
for num in range(1,101):
    if num % 3 is 0 and num % 5 is 0:
        print("Fizzbuzz")
    elif num % 3 is 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif num % 5 is 0:
        print("Buzz")
    
    else:
        print(num)
# End Loop

# For each number between 1 and 100, the loop checks if the value is a multiple of 3 or 5 by dividing it 
by either number and checking if there is a remainder. If the number is divisible by 3, 5, or 3 and 5, there 
is no remainder and therefore must be a multiple of those numbers. Otherwise, the loop simply prints the number.

Similarly, a loop performs a function that tests a variable against certain criteria, at whether or not that variable
meets or does not meet that criteria determines what the output of the loop statement will be.
